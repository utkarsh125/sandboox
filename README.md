#### What does this application do?
This is a simple application that is aimed towards testing of a .apk file before it is delivered to the consumers. For this, a lot of frameworks are needed. On further studies, I came to a conclusion that this application does not have a singular codebase (meaning that it uses things from different tech-stacks.

#### Technology Stack
- typescript as the primary language at the frontend
- turborepo as the monorepo
- nextjs as the primary frontend framework
- golang for backend routes and logic 
the list is not yet complete, the stack is subject to a change.
